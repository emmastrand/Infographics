The disconnect between the general public and the scientiic community is essentially an advertising issue. You can't get someone to actively makes changes and be involved in/support a movement if they don't care about it. And you can't get someone to care about something if they don't know about it. 


## General Rules: Marketing 

This is all advertising. Ditch your scientific tendencies to write everything you know onto the page. Less is more and how you present the information makes a difference for an effective infographic that gets someone's attention. Think about when you're at a conference during a poster session. You have some posters that you will go see no matter what they look like because of the topic, but the rest you'll wander the session scanning the titles and top half of the poster. The posters you approach outside of your specific field are likely to be the ones that look the best and aren't overwhelmed with text. You can't wow them with your insane scientific knowledge if you can't get their attention to begin with. **Design draws the attention, and content keeps it.**  

One of the most effective scientific marketing strategies I've seen is [The Ocean Agency](https://theoceanagency.org/). Their design is clean, simple, and repetitive with themes. Why was Chasing Coral so successful compared to other similar documentaries? Visuals and presentation is everything. 

### Purpose and Audience 

### Choosing Color
Different colors convey different meanings, emotions, feelings. Choose Only a few. Contrast is important.

Great examples of choosing color:

Insert note on addressing color blindness.

### Simple Shapes
If you look closely, most visuals in an infographic are actually simple shapes put together to create an image. The trick is to use different shades of the same color to give a three dimensional look.

### Themes

### Spacing and Flow

### Less is More
Go easy on the eyes and ditch all the text. 

Below are examples of good levels of content:
